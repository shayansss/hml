This subdirectory contains the essential source code of the [MeshGraphNets](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/meshgraphnets) (considering that we deleted the unused files and kept their licence unchanged). As explained in the [paper](https://shayansss.github.io/files/2022_06.pdf), few changes were applied to the original code mostly by `gnn.py` (in the root directory).
