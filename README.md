# Hybrid machine learning for finite element surrogate modeling of soft tissues
This repository contains the research code of our *under review* paper entitled "**Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling through hybrid machine learning for biomechanical and finite element analysis of soft tissues**".

Typically, to speed up the numerical simulation, surrogates are used, and for which the numerical results are generated and gathered in some datasets by an expensive numerical solver to then train a fast machine learning model used instead of the slow numerical model. Our developed hybrid algorithm utilized a similar method, however, it has first a reduced-order (but fast enough) numerical submodel that can give some rough estimation of the results. Second, a machine learning submodel within this HML implementation can then improve the accuracy of the estimated results to the level of the high-fidelity results. The main benefits of it, which is potentially applicable in many of the soft tissue finite element simulations, are that it is non-destructive (comparing many other techniques of the model order reduction) and can learn faster with fewer training data (compared to the regular machine learning methods). In addition, in this work, we performed some empirical tests, as elaborated in the paper.

## Dependency
For machine learning implementation:
- Python >= 3.8.8
- Jupyter Notebook >= 6.3.0
- matplotlib >= 3.3.4
- numpy >= 1.20.1
- scikit-learn >= 0.24.1
- tensorflow >= 2.5.0
- keras >= 2.4.3
- h5py = 2.10.0
- keras-tuner >= 1.0.1

For generation of datasets and contour plots:
- Visual Studio = 2019 (at least the Community edition)
- IntelÂ® Parallel Studio XE = 2020 with Update 4
- Abaqus/CAE = 2020 (full version)

## Installation
You should install all the dependencies with the versions specified (tested successfully on Windows 10). For simple installation of the Python libraries and relevant tools, use [(Ana)conda](https://www.anaconda.com/). For the numerical implementation, before the Abaqus installation, install the other software packages, which can be tricky, as they should be linked properly (for the Fortran subroutine implementation). This is described (with some other similar versions) in [this tutorial](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.33539.32800). Now, download the archive file using `git clone https://github.com/shayansss/hml`, and next, as the address of the root directory of the local repository (in your system) may not be the same as the one defined in the code, you should change it to your local address by correcting the default values that are fed to: 1) the `parentFolder` local variable of the `abaqus` function inside the `Hybrid_ml.ipynb` file; 2) the `os.chdir` function inside all the `*.py` files. Likewise, you should open the `NEW.cae` file and set the corrected directory address of the Fortran subroutine file, which is accessible by first opening the `NEW.cae` file via Abaqus/CAE, and next, find the `PlaneStrain` Abaqus job setting, where you can set the new address. Finally, save it before performing implementing the following steps.

## Dataset preparation
In the root directory, create the datasets by applying these commands: `abaqus cae noGui=data_generation_2d.py`, `abaqus cae noGui=data_generation_2d_lowfidelity.py`, `abaqus cae noGui=data_generation_3d.py`, and `abaqus cae noGui=data_generation_3d_lowfidelity.py`, which automatically generate them. Note that depending on your system, it may take between minutes to hours to have them all. Next, using `Hybrid_ml.ipynb`, the datasets are loaded before training, and then they are scaled using the `scaler` function. Besides, the odd and even rows for the datasets of the 2D models refer to two different simulations (namely the axial and shear tests). Similarly, for the output datasets, the labels of each sample, which are in a matrix form, are located below each other, associating to each of the input rows. Thus, they are reshaped to create separate datasets using the `preprocessing` function.

## Experiment workflow
By running the `Hybrid_ml.ipynb` file, the datasets are prepared, as elaborated above, and after that, the runtimes of the numerical simulations are compared. Next, the tuning and training processes are run, and their results are evaluated and illustrated. In the end, for the final illustration, we should employ the `Abaqus` function that calls Abaqus/CAE to save the contours via another script of Abaqus/CAE, i.e., `Visualization.py`. All the results are also saved in the root directory.

## Evaluation and expected results
We ran tests for different simulations, hyperparameters, etc., and the results are illustrated and compared. These results demonstrate that the hybrid versions can mostly outperform their machine learning counterparts, as explained in the paper. We also use the early stopping algorithm, ensuring the models do not overfit. Besides, some metrics are selected to approximate the errors; in particular, the implemented *point-wise mean square error* is described in our [previous work](https://shayansss.github.io/files/2021_11.pdf).

## Experiment customization
In the `Hybrid_ml.ipynb` file, the hyperparameter tuning conditions may be changed by their variables, e.g., using the `max_trialsList` (defining the number of iterations for tuning; increasing this might result in a very expensive and time-consuming implementation, since with the current setting, it took us several days to finish the tuning).  You may also change the arguments of the `train_model` function to define a different architecture of the neural networks for the 3D models.

Furthermore, the numerical model and physics problem can be changed using the options available in Abaqus/CAE, and for this, just note that you should change both the high- and low-fidelity models together. On the other hand, you can increase the fidelity of the constitutive equations by the `NONLIPLS.for` and `*.cae` files, although it may increase the computational costs extremely, as described in our previous study on the [bone-cartilage modeling](https://shayansss.github.io/files/2019_09_preprint.pdf) and [pre-stress modeling](https://shayansss.github.io/files/2021_02.pdf). This procedure is straightforward, as elaborated in the paper, but regardless of any surrogate you implement using Abaqus, some knowledge of the Abaqus scripting is needed to update the `*.py` files (used in automatic generation of datasets).
